        SPREADING HOPE EVERYWHERE FOUNDATION (S.H.E.W.) is a non-profit
        organisation and charity organisation. Started by Rosaline Alexander, in
        2018 as she is so torn apart by seeing so many vulnerable children
        living on the streets without basic needs nor proper education. The
        charity was approved in 2019 by the CAC (Corporate Affairs Commission)
        in Nigeria. Certificate number CAC/RC-128677 The records can be found on
        https://publicsearch.cac.gov.ng/ With Registration name Spreading Hope
        Everywhere Foundation Rose and her team of trustees are aiming to build
        a better world for everyone, and that is why they need your help.
        S.H.E.W. Foundation started small in 2018 and is now growing to make an
        impact. Help S.H.E.W. All donations go towards food, essentials,
        clothing and a better online presence to make others aware about our
        charity.

        Raising a child takes a village. By helping those in need, we aim for
        regions that lack the tools and food. Providing them the much needed
        capital to build a solid ecosystem in education, self-development and
        nutrition.

      nutrition More han 800 million people have not enough to eat Children
